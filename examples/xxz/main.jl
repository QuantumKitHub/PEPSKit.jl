# Néel order in the $U(1)$-symmetric XXZ model

Here, we want to look at a special case of the Heisenberg model, where the $x$ and $y$
couplings are equal, called the XXZ model

```math
H_0 = J \big(\sum_{\langle i, j \rangle} S_i^x S_j^x + S_i^y S_j^y + \Delta S_i^z S_j^z \big) .
```

For appropriate $\Delta$, the model enters an antiferromagnetic phase (Néel order) which we
will force by adding staggered magnetic charges to $H_0$. Furthermore, since the XXZ
Hamiltonian obeys a $U(1)$ symmetry, we will make use of that and work with $U(1)$-symmetric
PEPS and CTMRG environments. For simplicity, we will consider spin-$1/2$ operators.

But first, let's make this example deterministic and import the required packages:
"""

using Random
using TensorKit, PEPSKit
using MPSKit: add_physical_charge
Random.seed!(2928528935);

md"""
## Constructing the model

Let us define the $U(1)$-symmetric XXZ Hamiltonian on a $2 \times 2$ unit cell with the
parameters:
"""

J = 1.0
Delta = 1.0
spin = 1//2
symmetry = U1Irrep
lattice = InfiniteSquare(2, 2)
H₀ = heisenberg_XXZ(ComplexF64, symmetry, lattice; J, Delta, spin);

md"""
This ensures that our PEPS ansatz can support the bipartite Néel order. As discussed above,
we encode the Néel order directly in the ansatz by adding staggered auxiliary physical
charges:
"""

S_aux = [
    U1Irrep(-1//2) U1Irrep(1//2)
    U1Irrep(1//2) U1Irrep(-1//2)
]
H = add_physical_charge(H₀, S_aux);

md"""
## Specifying the symmetric virtual spaces

Before we create an initial PEPS and CTM environment, we need to think about which
symmetric spaces we need to construct. Since we want to exploit the global $U(1)$ symmetry
of the model, we will use TensorKit's `U1Space`s where we specify dimensions for each
symmetry sector. From the virtual spaces, we will need to construct a unit cell (a matrix)
of spaces which will be supplied to the PEPS constructor. The same is true for the physical
spaces, which can be extracted directly from the Hamiltonian `LocalOperator`:
"""

V_peps = U1Space(0 => 2, 1 => 1, -1 => 1)
V_env = U1Space(0 => 6, 1 => 4, -1 => 4, 2 => 2, -2 => 2)
virtual_spaces = fill(V_peps, size(lattice)...)
physical_spaces = physicalspace(H)

md"""
## Ground state search

From this point onwards it's business as usual: Create an initial PEPS and environment
(using the symmetric spaces), specify the algorithmic parameters and optimize:
"""

boundary_alg = (; tol=1e-8, alg=:simultaneous, trscheme=(; alg=:fixedspace))
gradient_alg = (; tol=1e-6, alg=:eigsolver, maxiter=10, iterscheme=:diffgauge)
optimizer_alg = (; tol=1e-4, alg=:lbfgs, maxiter=85, ls_maxiter=3, ls_maxfg=3)

peps₀ = InfinitePEPS(randn, ComplexF64, physical_spaces, virtual_spaces)
env₀, = leading_boundary(CTMRGEnv(peps₀, V_env), peps₀; boundary_alg...);

md"""
Finally, we can optimize the PEPS with respect to the XXZ Hamiltonian. Note that the
optimization might take a while since precompilation of symmetric AD code takes longer and
because symmetric tensors do create a bit of overhead (which does pay off at larger bond
and environment dimensions):
"""

peps, env, E, info = fixedpoint(
    H, peps₀, env₀; boundary_alg, gradient_alg, optimizer_alg, verbosity=3
)
@show E;

md"""
Note that for the specified parameters $J = \Delta = 1$, we simulated the same Hamiltonian as
in the [Heisenberg example](@ref examples_heisenberg). In that example, with a non-symmetric
$D=2$ PEPS simulation, we reached a ground-state energy of around $E_\text{D=2} = -0.6625\dots$.
Again comparing against [Sandvik's](@cite sandvik_computational_2011) accurate QMC estimate
``E_{\text{ref}}=−0.6694421``, we see that we already got closer to the reference energy.
