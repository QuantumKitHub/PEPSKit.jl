Absorb or remove environment weight on axis `ax` of vertex tensor `t`

# Arguments
- `t::T`: The vertex tensor to which the weight will be absorbed. The first axis of `t` should be the physical axis. 
- `row::Int`: The row index specifying the position in the tensor network.
- `col::Int`: The column index specifying the position in the tensor network.
- `ax::Int`: The axis along which the weight is absorbed.
- `weights::SUWeight`: The weight object to absorb into the tensor.
- `sqrtwt::Bool=false` (optional): If `true`, the square root of the weight is absorbed.
- `invwt::Bool=false` (optional): If `true`, the inverse of the weight is absorbed.

# Details
The optional kwargs `sqrtwt` and `invwt` allow taking the square root or the inverse of the weight before absorption. 

# Examples
```julia
# Absorb the weight into the 2nd axis of tensor at position (2, 3)
absorb_weight(t, 2, 3, 2, weights)

# Absorb the square root of the weight into the tensor
absorb_weight(t, 2, 3, 2, weights; sqrtwt=true)

# Absorb the inverse of (i.e. remove) the weight into the tensor
absorb_weight(t, 2, 3, 2, weights; invwt=true)
